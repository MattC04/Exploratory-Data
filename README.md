# California Housing Price Analysis and Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on the analysis and prediction of housing prices in California using a dataset from the 1990 California housing census. The goal is to provide insights into the factors affecting housing prices and to build predictive models using machine learning algorithms.

## Introduction
This project aims to provide an introductory case study using basic statistical knowledge and machine learning techniques to analyze and predict housing prices in California. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains information about various features such as median income, house age, total rooms, and more.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle: [California Housing Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices). It consists of the following columns:
- `longitude`: The longitude of the property.
- `latitude`: The latitude of the property.
- `housing_median_age`: The median age of the house.
- `total_rooms`: The total number of rooms in the house.
- `total_bedrooms`: The total number of bedrooms in the house.
- `population`: The population of the area.
- `households`: The number of households in the area.
- `median_income`: The median income of the household.
- `median_house_value`: The median house value.
